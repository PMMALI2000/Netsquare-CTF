Welcome to the Netsquare CTF repository! This challenge includes a mix of web and network-based tasks designed to test your cybersecurity skills. Created for educational purposes, it aims to provide hands-on experience in areas like Enumeration, encryption bypass, path traversal, file upload vulnerability, and privilege escalation.

## Key Features
- **Web Exploitation**: Explore path traversal, encryption bypass, file upload bypasses, and more.
- **Network Challenges**: Service enumeration and reverse shell exploitation.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Test your skills with SUID binaries and misconfigured permissions.

## Resources
- **Download the OVA File**: [Link to OVA](https://your-file-sharing-link.com)
